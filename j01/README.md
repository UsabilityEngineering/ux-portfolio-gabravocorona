I live in Lake Tahoe a nice and calm place where we only worry about the bears breaking in to the trash and making a mess. One day my dad notices that his bike was missing and was then worried if they were they going to go back and steal something else. He told me that we then needed to get some securyty cameras that will help us monitor all of our belongings outside of our house I then saw that there was an amazing deal at Costco 3 (3 Outside Camers, 1 Ring Camera, 1 indoor camera) It was a good deal for a pack of cameras.

A narrative that tells a story of a particular user experience you had with technology. It should include your goals, a description of the interaction, and the outcome. You should assess the user experience in terms of concepts taught in class and/or the most relevant UX goals: (effective, efficient, safe, satisfying, learnable, memorable, useful, error tolerant) but only highlight the most relevant concepts. When any of the terms are used in your narrative, you should highlight them in bold (surround word with double asterisks in markdown e.g. **word**) and provide a description in your own words. Each journal entry should have at least one unique term that is described (not already in a previous journal entry). The assessment of the interaction can be nuanced, acknowledging any strengths and weaknesses. Suggestions for how the weaknesses can be addressed will make for a particularly strong journal entry.

Keep in mind that the journal entry is a narrative of a particular experience, not a general product review

The writing style should resemble a relatively informal style of blogs. The entries should also communicate to a broad audience, who do not necessarily know UX terminology, so make sure to describe things in a way most people can understand.
