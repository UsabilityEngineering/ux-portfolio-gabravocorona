I live in Lake Tahoe, a nice and calm place where we only worry about the bears breaking into the trash and making a mess. One day my dad noticed that his bike was missing and was then worried that whoever took the bike was going to come back and try to steal something else from outside or the shed. He instantly called me and told me that we then needed to get some security cameras that will help us monitor all areas outside of our house I then saw that there was an amazing deal at Costco 3 (3 Outside Cameras, 1 Ring Camera, 1 indoor camera) I thought it was a good deal for a pack of cameras and since we needed something available ASAP those were great. Reading the box instructions and information of what is needed to be able to set them up it seemed like a **SALIENT** product. The setup process for the cameras was intuitive no cables were required, and they were easy to install with just batteries. The design is both accessible and effortless, making monitoring our surroundings a streamlined and engaging experience.

Once I opened the box I was expecting it to be easy setting the cameras up and just downloading the app and being able to see the cameras like it said in the box. I was really expecting a simple application where I was able to monitor the cameras at all times. I also expected the app on the phone to be easy to understand and easy to learn when I first opened the app. I was also expecting a free no subscription application since the cameras are mostly used for the safety of the users and to monitor the users property. The app lacked effective **FEEDBACK**, leaving me unsure of whether my actions were registering with the cameras. Additionally, the app's poor **AFFORDANCE** made it difficult to understand its functionalities and available interactions, with no clear guidance on where to find settings or navigate through the options.

In the end the outcome was not what I expected. The process wasn't hard to understand, I was able to sync the cameras to the Sync Module that will store the recorded videos. I was not aware that I was going to need to buy a usb flash drive to be able to save the videos so I had to buy it separately. The **HEURISTIC** evaluation of the application's design highlighted significant flaws in user control and freedom. The lack of upfront information about the necessary subscription for essential features heavily impacted the usability and overall satisfaction, taking away important functionalities that users expect to customize for their security needs. The design of the application, the user control and user freedom was horrible. I wasn't expecting to need to pay for a monthly subscription plan where I would be able to have more user control over the cameras and be able to use the different security modes or just customize the settings to my likings. It's really taking away a lot of the important and more useful tools of the cameras that really makes the users/buyers regret their purchase. Paying to be able to mute the notifications and being able to create personal settings is really the down side of the cameras. It should be free for the user to be able to personalize the type of security and the cameras to a specific liking when in the end most of the users buy the cameras for security.
